"text":"Since 2017 I have had the distinct pleasure of touring with the wildly entertaining blues/soul artist, Dana Fuchs from Harlem, NY. Dana played the character, 'Sexy Sadie' in the cult classic, 'Across The Universe.' Dana has a distinct rasp in her voice many compare to Janis Joplin while remaining smooth and soulful. We can be seen and heard all across the United States and Europe."

"text":"I have had the distinct pleasure of sharing the stage with Nicole Atkins through-out the years. Nicole is often compared to Roy Orbison and many others from the 195 'crooner' era as well as 1960's pschedelic soul. She is coined with The Golden Voice. Her charming delivery and deep rooted vocals bring listeners to a different time and space."

Gedeon grew up in Memphis and grasped the attention of producers all over the country when he made it to the final round of American Idol some years back. Its a big ole' soul band fusing Funk, Soul, Rock, Blues and Gospel music."

"text":"I got a call to do a music video with a metal band from Norway. I dont play metal! I did it and it lead to me getting hired by the guitarist Mike Orlando of 'Adrenaline Mob' and vocalist Corey Glover of 'Living Colour.' Their original music was a fusion of hard rock, metal, and almost composition-like classical music. To say the least that was one of the most rewarding gigs I have ever done."

You dont find that with many acts these days. These guys have got the feel good-upbeat jams that keep you movin'. We hit a bunch of great festivals and venues together including Firefly Music Festival, Panorama Music Festival, and the Rainbow Room."
